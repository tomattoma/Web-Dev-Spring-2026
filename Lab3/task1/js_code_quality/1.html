// Regular users don’t see that output, it is in the console. To see it, 
// either open the Console panel of developer tools or press Esc while in another panel: that opens the console at the bottom.
// If we have enough logging in our code, then we can see what’s going on from the records, without the debugger.

// Summary
// As we can see, there are three main ways to pause a script:

// A breakpoint.
// The debugger statements.
// An error (if dev tools are open and the button  is “on”).
