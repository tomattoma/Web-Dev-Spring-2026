        Polyfills
// New language features may include not only syntax constructs and operators, but also built-in functions.

// For example, Math.trunc(n) is a function that “cuts off” the decimal part of a number, e.g Math.trunc(1.23) returns 1.

// In some (very outdated) JavaScript engines, there’s no Math.trunc, so such code will fail.

// As we’re talking about new functions, not syntax changes, there’s no need to transpile anything here. We just need to declare the missing function.

// A script that updates/adds new functions is called “polyfill”. It “fills in” the gap and adds missing implementations.

// For this particular case, the polyfill for Math.trunc is a script that implements it, like this:
if (!Math.trunc) { // if no such function
  // implement it
  Math.trunc = function(number) {
    // Math.ceil and Math.floor exist even in ancient JavaScript engines
    // they are covered later in the tutorial
    return number < 0 ? Math.ceil(number) : Math.floor(number);
  };
}
