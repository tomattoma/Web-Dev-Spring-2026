//         Brevity is the soul of wit
// Make the code as short as possible. Show how smart you are.

// Let subtle language features guide you.

// For instance, take a look at this ternary operator '?':

// taken from a well-known javascript library
i = i ? i < 0 ? Math.max(0, len + i) : i : 0;

// Use abbreviations
// If the team rules forbid the use of one-letter and vague names – shorten them, make abbreviations.

// Like this:

// list → lst.
// userAgent → ua.
// browser → brsr.
// …etc
// Only the one with truly good intuition will be able to understand such names. Try to shorten everything.
//  Only a worthy person should be able to uphold the development of your code.

// Soar high. Be abstract.
// The great square is cornerless
// The great vessel is last complete,
// The great note is rarified sound,
// The great image has no form.
